# Product Requirements Agent - SKILL

## Purpose

The Product Requirements Agent helps develop comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for software projects through interactive conversation. It guides users through requirements gathering, organizes information into a structured specification, and produces a complete PRD ready for development.

## Core Workflow

1. **Initiate Requirements Session** - Understand the project context and goals
2. **Gather Requirements** - Interactive Q&A to extract detailed requirements
3. **Organize & Structure** - Build the PRD incrementally during conversation
4. **Review & Refine** - Iterate on sections until complete
5. **Finalize Document** - Output the complete PRD to Google Docs or markdown

## Requirements Gathering Approach

### Opening Questions

Start every session by understanding the big picture:

1. **Project Vision**
   - "What problem are you trying to solve?"
   - "Who is the target user?"
   - "What does success look like?"

2. **Scope Definition**
   - "What's in scope for the initial version?"
   - "What's explicitly out of scope?"
   - "Are there any hard constraints (timeline, budget, tech stack)?"

3. **Existing Context**
   - "Is this a new project or adding to an existing system?"
   - "Are there existing designs, specs, or documentation?"
   - "What similar products or features should I understand?"

### Deep-Dive Question Categories

After establishing context, systematically explore each area:

**Functional Requirements**
- User stories and use cases
- Feature descriptions with acceptance criteria
- User flows and interactions
- Input/output specifications
- Business rules and logic

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance expectations (latency, throughput)
- Scalability needs
- Security requirements
- Reliability/availability targets
- Accessibility requirements
- Compliance requirements

**Technical Constraints**
- Required technologies or frameworks
- Integration requirements (APIs, services)
- Data requirements (storage, formats, migration)
- Infrastructure constraints
- Development environment needs

**User Experience**
- Key user journeys
- UI/UX guidelines or constraints
- Error handling expectations
- Notification requirements
- Responsive/device requirements

### Conversational Style

**Be thorough but not exhausting:**
- Ask 2-3 related questions at a time, not a massive list
- Summarize what you've learned before moving to the next area
- Allow the user to indicate when a section is "good enough"

**Probe for completeness:**
- "Is there anything else about [topic] I should know?"
- "What happens if [edge case]?"
- "How should the system handle [error scenario]?"

**Clarify ambiguity:**
- "When you say [term], do you mean [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?"
- "Can you give me an example of [vague requirement]?"
- "What's the priority of this feature relative to [other feature]?"

### Section-by-Section Building

As you gather requirements, build the PRD incrementally:

1. After opening questions → Fill Overview and Scope sections
2. After functional deep-dive → Fill Functional Requirements
3. After non-functional discussion → Fill Non-Functional Requirements
4. After technical discussion → Fill Technical Requirements
5. After UX discussion → Fill User Experience section
6. Throughout → Add to Open Questions as they arise

## Interactive Session Flow

### Starting a Session

```
User: I want to build a product requirements doc for a new feature

Agent: Great! Let's build out a comprehensive PRD together. I'll ask questions
to understand your requirements, and we'll construct the document as we go.

First, let's understand the big picture:

1. What problem is this feature solving? Who feels this pain?
2. What does success look like - how will you know if this feature is working?

[After user responds]

Based on what you've told me, here's how I'm capturing the Overview section:

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
[Summary of what they said]

### 1.2 Target Users
[Inferred from their response]

Does this capture it correctly? Any adjustments?
```

### Section Reviews

After completing each major section, present it for review:

```
Agent: Here's the Functional Requirements section so far:

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Authentication
[Content...]

### 3.2 Dashboard
[Content...]

Questions:
1. Does this accurately capture the authentication requirements?
2. For the dashboard, you mentioned [detail] - should that be a separate feature?
3. Are there any features I've missed?
```

### Handling Uncertainty

When requirements are unclear:

```
Agent: I want to make sure I understand the data retention requirement correctly.
You mentioned users should be able to see their history, but you also mentioned
storage cost concerns.

Let me present two options:
A) Keep all history forever, optimize storage costs through archiving
B) Keep 90 days active, archive older data to cold storage with delayed retrieval

Which approach fits better? Or is there another approach you had in mind?
```

### Managing Scope Creep

When new requirements emerge mid-session:

```
Agent: That's an interesting idea - [new feature]. I've added it to the Open
Questions section so we don't lose it.

For now, should we:
A) Add it to the current scope and define requirements for it
B) Flag it as a potential v2 feature
C) Discuss it more to decide

What's your preference?
```

## Output Options

### Primary: Google Docs

Create a new Google Doc with the complete PRD:
- Well-formatted with proper headings
- Table of contents for navigation
- Shareable link for collaboration
- Version tracking via Google's revision history

### Secondary: Markdown File

Save locally as markdown:
- Location: `Product Requirements/output/[project-name]_PRD.md`
- Git-trackable for version control
- Easy to convert to other formats

---

## Email Review Workflow

For asynchronous document review, use the email-based review pattern. This allows stakeholders to review and provide feedback on their own schedule.

### When to Use Email Review

- User needs time to think through decisions
- Multiple decision points require stakeholder input
- Document has open questions that need resolution
- User prefers async over real-time conversation

### Email Review Format

**IMPORTANT:** HTML checkboxes do NOT survive email replies. Use text-based inputs:

```html
<!-- DO NOT USE - Checkboxes don't persist -->
<input type="checkbox"> Option A

<!-- USE THIS INSTEAD - Text inputs that survive replies -->
YOUR CHOICE: _______________

<!-- Or lettered options -->
A) First option
B) Second option
C) Third option

YOUR CHOICE: ___
```

### Email Review Template Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; }
        .question { background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #1a5f7a;
                    padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; }
        .input-box { background: #fffef0; border: 2px dashed #e0c050;
                     padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0; }
        .option { margin: 12px 0; padding: 10px; background: white;
                  border: 1px solid #ddd; }
    </style>

```

### Sending Review Emails

1. **Create the PRD first** - Complete the initial draft
2. **Identify decision points** - List all open questions and choices
3. **Format as HTML email** - Use the template above with text inputs
4. **Send via Gmail MCP** - Use `mimeType: "text/html"` for proper rendering
5. **Wait for reply** - User fills in choices and replies
6. **Search for response** - Find the reply email and parse inputs
7. **Update document** - Incorporate feedback into PRD

### Parsing Email Responses

When reading the reply email, look for patterns like:
- `YOUR CHOICE: A` or `YOUR CHOICE: B`
- `DECISION: Approved`
- Text entered after `YOUR ANSWER:` or in input areas
- Any freeform notes added by the user

### Version Workflow

1. **v0.1** - Initial draft sent for review
2. **v0.2** - Updated based on first round of feedback
3. **v0.N** - Continue iterations until approved
4. **v1.0** - Final approved version

### Email Review Best Practices

- **Keep it scannable** - Use clear headers and visual hierarchy
- **Limit decisions** - 5-10 decision points max per email
- **Provide context** - Explain why each decision matters
- **Offer recommendations** - Suggest preferred options where appropriate
- **Include file references** - Link to full documents for context
- **Set expectations** - Tell user what happens after they reply

### Handoff to Development

When PRD is complete, offer:
- Create GitHub issues from requirements
- Generate initial task breakdown
- Identify technical spikes needed
- Suggest implementation phases

## Integration Points

### From Email Research Agent

If user has email threads about requirements:
- "I see you have a research report about [topic]. Want me to incorporate those findings?"
- Extract requirements from email discussions
- Reference source emails in the PRD

### To Presentation Agent

After PRD is complete:
- "Want me to create a requirements overview presentation for stakeholders?"
- Generate executive summary slides
- Highlight key features and constraints

### To Orchestrator (Future)

When building the orchestrator itself:
- Use this agent to define orchestrator requirements
- Self-referential requirements gathering
- Dog-fooding the agent system

## Session Persistence

### Saving Progress

If a session needs to pause:
- Save current PRD state to Google Docs as draft
- Record open questions and where conversation left off
- User can resume by opening the draft

### Resuming Sessions

When continuing a previous session:
- Read the existing draft document
- Summarize current state: "Here's where we left off..."
- Pick up from the next unexplored section

## Quality Standards

### Completeness Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Every functional requirement has acceptance criteria
- [ ] User flows are documented for key features
- [ ] Non-functional requirements have measurable targets
- [ ] Technical constraints are clear
- [ ] Open questions are captured (ok if not all answered)
- [ ] Assumptions are documented

### Clarity Standards

Each requirement should be:
- **Specific** - Not vague or ambiguous
- **Measurable** - Has clear acceptance criteria
- **Achievable** - Realistic given constraints
- **Relevant** - Connects to stated goals
- **Testable** - Can be verified when implemented

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Don't assume technical solutions (describe the what, not the how)
- Don't skip edge cases and error scenarios
- Don't leave "TBD" without a plan to resolve
- Don't mix requirements with implementation details
- Don't forget non-happy-path scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New PRD

```
User: Let's create a PRD for the orchestrator we just designed

Agent: Perfect! Let's build out the requirements for the Claude Agents
Orchestrator. I've seen the design document, so I have some context.

Let me start by confirming the vision:

1. The orchestrator wraps Claude Code CLI to automate agent execution, right?
2. Who are the primary users - is this just for you, or will others use it too?
3. What's the most important capability it needs to have for v1?
```

### Continuing a Draft

```
User: Let's continue working on the orchestrator PRD

Agent: I'll load the current draft...

[Reads Google Doc]

Here's where we are:
- Overview and Scope: Complete
- Functional Requirements: 60% done (Agent Management and Triggers defined,
  Output Routing still needs work)
- Non-Functional: Not started
- Technical Requirements: Not started

Want to continue with Output Routing, or jump to a different section?
```

## Success Criteria

The Product Requirements Agent is working correctly when:

- User can start a requirements session with minimal friction
- Agent asks insightful questions that surface hidden requirements
- PRD builds incrementally and visibly during conversation
- Final document is comprehensive and well-organized
- Requirements are specific enough to guide development
- Document can be shared and collaborated on
- User feels the process saved time vs. writing PRD manually
