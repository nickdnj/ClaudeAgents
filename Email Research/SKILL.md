# Email Research Agent - SKILL

## Purpose

The Email Research Agent mines Gmail for emails on a specific topic and generates a structured research report. This report serves as an input to other agents (like Presentation) or as the basis for composing follow-up emails.

## Core Workflow

1. **Receive Research Topic** - User specifies what to research
2. **Mine Gmail** - Search for relevant emails using Gmail MCP
3. **Analyze & Organize** - Extract key information and themes
4. **Generate Report** - Send structured report as HTML email (v0.1)
5. **Iterate via Email** - User replies with feedback, agent sends updated versions
6. **Finalize** - Report ready for use by other agents

## Input Requirements

### Research Topic Specification
The user provides:
- **Topic/Keywords**: What to search for (e.g., "boiler project", "parking policy", "marina permits")
- **Timeframe** (optional): How far back to search (default: 90 days)
- **Focus** (optional): Specific aspects to emphasize

### Natural Language Understanding
Understand various ways users express research requests:

- "Research everything about the boiler project"
- "Find all emails about parking"
- "What have we discussed about the marina permits?"
- "Pull together info on the budget discussions"

## Email Mining Strategy

### Gmail Accounts

Two accounts are available for searching:

| Account | Address | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **board** (default) | `nickd@wharfsidemb.com` | Current board email |
| **personal** | `nickd@demarconet.com` | Historical board business & prior board tenure |

- Default lookback: 90 days (configurable)
- By default, searches use the board account
- User can specify "search my personal email" or "search both accounts"
- For comprehensive historical research, search both accounts

### Search Approach

1. **Primary Search**
   - Use topic keywords in Gmail search
   - Include variations and related terms
   - Search subject lines and body content

2. **Thread Expansion**
   - When finding relevant emails, include full thread context
   - Capture replies and follow-ups

3. **Sender Context**
   - Note who is involved in discussions
   - Identify key stakeholders

4. **Handling Search Result Limits (CRITICAL)**
   - Gmail MCP searches are limited to ~100 results per query
   - **When a search returns the maximum number of results, you MUST dig deeper**
   - Break the time period into smaller ranges and search again
   - Continue until all searches return fewer than the maximum results

   **Example:** If searching "marina" returns 100 results for 2024:
   ```
   Initial search: marina after:2024/01/01 before:2025/01/01 → 100 results (MAX HIT)

   Break into quarters:
   - marina after:2024/01/01 before:2024/04/01 → 45 results ✓
   - marina after:2024/04/01 before:2024/07/01 → 100 results (MAX HIT - dig deeper)
   - marina after:2024/07/01 before:2024/10/01 → 30 results ✓
   - marina after:2024/10/01 before:2025/01/01 → 55 results ✓

   For Q2 that hit max, break into months:
   - marina after:2024/04/01 before:2024/05/01 → 60 results ✓
   - marina after:2024/05/01 before:2024/06/01 → 40 results ✓
   - marina after:2024/06/01 before:2024/07/01 → 25 results ✓
   ```

   - This ensures no emails are missed due to result limits
   - Track which time periods hit the limit and report this to the user
   - The goal is **complete coverage** - missing emails means missing important history

### Information Extraction

For each relevant email/thread, extract:
- **Date**: When the communication occurred
- **Participants**: Who was involved
- **Key Points**: Main information or decisions
- **Action Items**: Any tasks mentioned
- **Status Updates**: Progress or current state
- **Links/Attachments**: References to documents or resources
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues

## Quality Standards

### Completeness
- Capture all relevant communications
- Don't miss important threads
- Include context from thread replies

### Accuracy
- Quote specific figures and dates accurately
- Attribute information to correct sources
- Note when information is uncertain or incomplete

### Organization
- Logical flow of information
- Clear section headers
- Easy to scan and navigate

### Actionability
- Highlight next steps clearly
- Identify open questions
- Connect findings to potential actions

## Handoff to Other Agents

### To Presentation Agent
Provide:
- Topic summary
- Key data points (numbers, dates, names)
- Suggested slide structure
- Visual elements (charts, timelines)

### To Email Composition
Provide:
- Context summary
- Points to address
- Suggested tone
- Recipient recommendations

## Error Handling

### No Results Found
If search returns no relevant emails:
- Confirm search terms with user
- Suggest alternative keywords
- Offer to expand timeframe

### Too Many Results / Search Limit Hit
If search returns the maximum number of results (~100):
- **DO NOT ask user to narrow focus** - automatically dig deeper
- Break the time period into smaller ranges (see "Handling Search Result Limits" above)
- Continue subdividing until all searches return fewer than max results
- Only after ensuring complete coverage, inform the user of the total found
- If a topic genuinely has thousands of emails, offer to break into multiple reports by sub-topic

### Ambiguous Topics
If topic is unclear:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Present options for interpretation
- Start with broader search and refine

## Success Criteria

The Email Research Agent is working correctly when:

- User can request research on any topic
- Agent finds and organizes relevant emails
- Report is comprehensive and well-structured
- Findings are accurate and properly attributed
- User can easily use report for next steps
- Handoff to other agents is smooth
