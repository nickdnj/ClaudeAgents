## Executive Summary

The Wharfside Manor marina and dock infrastructure has been a central concern for the association throughout its history. What began as routine maintenance issues gradually escalated into a full infrastructure crisis by 2024, ultimately requiring complete dock replacement.

The critical turning point came in **April 2024** when contractor Louis Conte of Monmouth Dock Works discovered catastrophic structural failures during routine spring repairs. His formal refusal to accept liability "for any injuries or death" due to the deteriorated condition forced immediate dock closure and accelerated replacement planning.

As of January 2026, the association has executed a contract with **Twin Rivers Marine Construction** for complete dock replacement and is awaiting DEP Zane Exemption permit approval, with a statutory deadline of **February 9, 2026**. A special assessment has been levied to fund the approximately **$1.5-1.6 million** project.

## Outstanding Questions

1. **Permit Status:** Will DEP approve the Zane Exemption by February 9, 2026 deadline?

2. **Construction Timeline:** Once permit approved, what is the exact construction start date and completion estimate?

3. **Ice Eaters:** Were ice eaters successfully installed in December 2025? Current operational status?

4. **Bulkhead Long-term:** What is the expected remaining lifespan of the bulkhead after 2024 repairs? Will it need replacement in the future?

5. **Special Assessment:** What is the total special assessment amount and payment schedule for unit owners?

6. **Marina Revenue:** Will the new floating docks attract additional slip renters as projected?

## Action Items

- [ ] Follow up with Jack Kelly (Trident) on DEP application status before Feb 9 deadline
- [ ] Confirm ice eater installation and operational status
- [ ] Prepare construction kickoff timeline for after permit approval
- [ ] Document final special assessment details and payment schedule
- [ ] Plan marina patron communication for construction period

## Appendix A: Critical Contractor Liability Statement (April 11, 2024)

The following is the verbatim email from Louis Conte of Monmouth Dock Works that triggered the immediate dock closure:

> Now that we are out here doing some repair work to try to get you guys ready for the season it has come to my intention that the pier has further deteriorated to a dangerous level in my opinion. **the main joists that support the decking are completely rotted through in many locations at this time.** I would like to send this email and release myself and my company and workers of all liability regarding this pier due to the structural issues It is having.
>
> **I highly suggest that the pier does not open this season Until they are completely replaced.** Major portions of decking cannot be resecured because the supporting joists are completely rotten at this point. To reiterate, **I am accepting no liability nor is my company for any injuries or death or loss of property that may occur on these piers due to their poor condition**; and also suggest keeping them closed this season.

## Appendix C: Community Response (April 13, 2024)

Homeowner concerns posted on Facebook in response to marina closure:

> "While the docks may provide some value to the overall community the majority of homeowners did not buy their condos for the use of the docks. Maybe 15-20% of the homeowners own boats. Maybe sell the docks... Time to look at prioritizing the work that needs to be done at Wharfside to maintain a safe environment to live in and hold the value of the condo units. Given the fact that the plumbing is a mess and many units are being flooded with sewage... the roofs are also in disrepair... some of the balconies need to be replaced/repaired, another priority over docks."

Board member Nick DeMarco's response: "Besides the misunderstanding about the value of the docks to the association. She has valid points we need to address head-on."

Gary Passenti's response: "I guess they don't understand that we supplement fees with the docks open. In addition the value of the units will go down without the marina."
