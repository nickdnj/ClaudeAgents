## Executive Summary

2024 was a year of significant transition for the Wharfside Manor Board of Trustees. The year began with ongoing challenges from the 2023 election cycle, which had failed to reach quorum multiple times. After finally achieving quorum, a reconvened election meeting was held on **March 12, 2024**, resulting in the election of five new board members: Anthony D'Anna, Nick DeMarco, Giuseppe Gencarelli, Tim Mucaj, and Mike Serhat.

Throughout 2024, the board held multiple open meetings to address key community issues including the marina bid process, piping replacement, insurance premium increases, and the 2025 budget. The year concluded with another election cycle in November 2024 that also faced quorum challenges, requiring a reconvened meeting in December. A new board was seated in mid-December 2024, triggering a reorganization and task assignment process.
